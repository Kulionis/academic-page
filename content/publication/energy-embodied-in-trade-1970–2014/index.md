abstract: Ongoing globalisation combined with the rapid pace of technological
  change have generated significant growth in economic activities and have
  improved the welfare and living standards of many people around the world. e
  opening up of the world economy has also led to unprecedented surges in
  international trade and has fundamentally transformed the way that goods and
  services are produced, exchanged and consumed. In addition, the increasing
  separation of production and consumption activities has been accompanied by an
  increase in energy, resource and carbon content embodied in international
  trade. In general all economic activity requires the use of energy, which has
  a variety of environmental impacts. is dissertation examines how the
  relationship between energy use and economic growth evolved in high-income
  countries from 1970 to 2014 and the role of trade in this. e approach involves
  looking at the factors driving the change, how the importance of these factors
  has changed over time and how it differed across countries.

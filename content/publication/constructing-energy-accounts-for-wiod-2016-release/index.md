abstract: Most of today's products and services are made in global supply
  chains. As a result, a consumption of goods and services in one country is
  associated with various environmental pressures all over the world due to
  international trade. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have
  allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections
  between production and consumptions activities and associated environmental
  impacts. Due to a limited data availability there is little evidence about the
  more recent trends in global energy footprint. In order to expand the
  analytical potential of the existing WIOD 2016 dataset to a wider range of
  research themes, this paper develops energy accounts and presents the global
  energy footprint trends for the period 2000-2014.

abstract: "Increasing global production fragmentation allows for outsourcing of
  emissions, which may undermine national climate policies. Researchers focusing
  on the gap between consumption-based and production-based emissions have
  concluded that developed countries are systematically outsourcing emissions to
  developing countries. However, asymmetries in emissions embodied in trade may
  emerge due to differences in carbon intensity of energy and production between
  different countries, and need not be evidence of outsourcing. This study
  investigates if previous results concerning emission in –and outsourcing of
  developed and developing countries hold when emission flows are adjusted for
  technological differences. Two striking results are demonstrated: first, the
  magnitude of outsourcing is significantly smaller than previous studies have
  suggested, and, second, there is no clear divide between developing and
  developed countries. Large developed Anglophone countries (US, UK, Canada and
  Australia) were increasingly outsourcing emissions between 1995 and 2009 by
  shifting toward more carbon-intensive goods in their imports and less carbon
  intensive goods in exports, whereas other developed countries (i.e. the
  Nordics, advanced Asia and even the aggregate EU-27) maintained a positive
  emission trade balance. Among major developing countries, China is a major
  insourcer of emissions, while other emerging economies show no consistent
  pattern (e.g. India, Turkey and Brazil) or marginal outsourcing (e.g.
  Indonesia and Mexico). These results contribute to a more nuanced
  understanding of the impact of international trade on global carbon
  emissions."

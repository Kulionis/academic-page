abstract: "The decoupling of energy use from economic growth is an essential
  element in the transition to a sustainable future. However, little is known
  about the long-term drivers of decoupling, especially considering the
  possibility that it is at least partially due to increased trade. This study
  uses structural decomposition analysis to examine the main factors that
  contribute to changes in the energy footprint of Denmark, the United Kingdom,
  France and the United States of America back to 1970. The results show that
  the changes in energy footprint have been driven mainly by two countervailing
  forces: declines in energy intensity and increases in consumption per capita.
  Energy efficiency improvements that take place abroad play an increasingly
  important role. In recent years they accounted for a greater share of the
  reduction in energy footprint than domestic energy efficiency improvements.
  The trade sourcing effect was negligible in the beginning of the study period
  but has grown in importance since 1995 and accelerated the growth of the
  energy footprint by roughly 0.5% per year. Whilst the electricity sector has
  clearly played the dominant role, the contribution of factor changes in
  services and manufacturing should not be overlooked."

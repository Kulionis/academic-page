abstract: "The aim of this feasibility study is to combine the efforts on the
  measurement of environmental footprint indicators within the Green Economy
  Progress (GEP) Measurement Framework developed by UN Environment. More
  specifically, the study will focus on establishing the availability of data
  and the most appropriate database. This will be achieved by assessing the
  feasibility of a countryâ€™s specific footprints and recommending a methodology
  (as well as creating a link to the GEP Measurement Framework). In particular
  to its dashboard of environmental sustainability indicators, for the following
  footprints indicators (see appendix for more details): - greenhouse gas
  footprint - biodiversity footprint (based on LC Initiative recommendations for
  land use) - water footprint based on LC Initiative recommendations (AWARE).
  Additionally, the feasibility study will explore the linkages to the SCP-HAT
  tool, also developed by UN Environment aimed at supporting the design of
  national action plans for sustainable consumption and production."

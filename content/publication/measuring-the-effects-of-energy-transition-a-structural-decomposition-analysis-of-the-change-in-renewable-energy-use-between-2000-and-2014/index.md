abstract: "This study investigates the growth in global renewable energy use
  between 2000 and 2014. To identify its main contributors and their
  geographical distribution, a structural decomposition analysis is applied to
  global multi-regional input-output tables. A new variant of this type of
  analysis is developed that introduces energy transition (i.e. the substitution
  of non-renewable energy by renewable energy) as one of the contributors.
  Global renewable energy use rose by 22.1 Exa Joules (EJ), from 57.8 EJ in 2000
  to 79.9 in 2014. The contribution of energy transition at the global level to
  this 22.1 EJ increase was small and positive (+1.3 EJ). As for the
  geographical distribution of the effects, positive effects are found for the
  European Union and the United States, negative effects for China, India, and
  the Rest of the World (which includes many developing and emerging countries).
  Trade structure changes also had a small effect on global renewable energy use
  (+1.1 EJ). The main contributions were the worldwide changes in: technology
  and overall energy efficiency (âˆ’23.6 EJ); consumption per capita (+32.2EJ);
  and population (+11.0 EJ)."

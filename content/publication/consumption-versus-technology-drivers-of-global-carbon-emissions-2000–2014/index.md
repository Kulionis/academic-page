abstract: This study utilizes recently published environmental extensions to the
  World Input–Output Database (WIOD) to compare production-based,
  consumption-based and technology-adjusted carbon emissions for 44 countries
  and country groups for the period 2000 to 2014. Results show some significant
  shifts in global emission trends compared to similar studies of the period
  before 2009. For 20 European Union (EU) countries and the US, emissions
  decreased over the period regardless of measure, and the same was true for the
  EU. Since GDP grew in 18 of these countries, the results provide unambiguous
  evidence for absolute, albeit modest, decoupling of economic growth from
  carbon emissions. The large increase in global emissions that nevertheless
  occurred during the period was driven almost entirely by increasing
  consumption in China and developing countries.

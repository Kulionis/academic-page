abstract: This study utilizes a multivariate framework to test the causal
  relationship between renew- able energy consumption, gross domestic product
  (GDP) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Denmark using annual data from
  1972-2012. The causal relationship between variables is examined using Granger
  causality test in VAR framework. Results of unit root tests show that all
  variables are non-stationary in their level form and stationary in first
  difference form. Cointegration analysis following Johansen (1992) approach,
  shows that there is no evidence of cointegration among the test variables. The
  empirical results from Granger causality Toda-Yomamoto test and Granger
  causality test using first differences strongly supports a unid-rectional
  causality coming from renewable energy consumption to CO2 emissions. The
  results of this study also indicate that there is no statistically significant
  causality between the economic growth and renewable energy consumption, which
  supports the neutrality hypothesis and implies that energy conservation
  policies should not have a significant impact on economic growth. The
  empirical results also reveal that there is no causality between economic
  growth and CO2 emissions. This may be due to the fact that Denmark has one of
  the lowest energy intensities in the world, which allows to achieve one unit
  of GDP with a minimum input of energy and minimum CO2 emissions.

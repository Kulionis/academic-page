Petrochemical products are everywhere and are essential to modern economies. They include a wide range of practical products, including plastics, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, packaging, paints, building material, clothing, household goods, medical equipment and many others. They are also found in many parts of the modern energy system, including solar panels, wind turbine blades, batteries, thermal insulation for buildings, and electric vehicle parts.
Petrochemical feedstock accounts for 12% of global oil demand, which is expected to increase driven by increasing demand for plastics, fertilisers and other products. International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights that despite its size and growing importance, the sector continues to take a back seat in the global energy debate.
The petrochemical industry value chain is composed of several distinct but interrelated activities that transform raw material inputs or "feedstocks" (e.g. naphtha, natural gas) into valuable end-user products (e.g. plastics). In this project, I analyse the petrochemical industry's upstream and downstream supply chain and the associated environmental impacts.

This tool creates visual narratives about environmental pressures and impacts that each country, industry and city generate through production/consumption of goods and services. It was build using Python, and Plotly's dash framework and bootstrap components were used to design the front-end. Data processing and analysis were performed with pandas and NumPy. 


The dashboard consists of four key panels (views): global, country, industry and city. Each of these panels provides various insights and answer different questions. For instance, global panel offers comparisons between different countries based on different environmental metrics and indicators (e.g. carbon footprint, biodiversity loss). Sector Panel provides analytical insights about sectoral performance within or between countries. 

This dashboard app is available for demo.

Factor flow is an interactive data visualisation tool that helps to explore energy content embodied in international trade over time and space. It was built using python and plotly's dash framework.

Embodied energy is an accounting method which shows the sum of all the energy required to produce a specific good or service. For instance, car manufacturing requires various inputs such as steel, glass, rubber, etc. Production of these inputs requires energy, and thus they can be considered "embodied" in a car. 

The concept can help determine the total energy use associated with the consumption of a specific product. It can also be used to benchmark and compare the efficiency and effectiveness of various industries/companies. This is of particular importance, given that most of todayâ€™s goods and services are produced in global value chains. Understanding the embodied energy content of different inputs can inform sourcing policies and reveal which industries are more likely to be affected by changes in energy prices.

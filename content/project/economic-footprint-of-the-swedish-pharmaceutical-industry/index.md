The pharmaceutical industry is a significant component of the Swedish innovation-driven economy that generates large export incomes and contributes considerably to employment and welfare. In this project, I estimated and analysed the pharmaceutical industry's economic impact or "economic footprint" on the Swedish and Global economy.

The economic footprint of the pharmaceutical industry consists of several components: export earnings, employment, contributions to gross domestic product and investments in research and development. In this analysis, I have examined how the industry contributes to the economy through Gross Value Added (GVA) and employment. GVA captures the industry's contribution to Sweden's GDP.  Mathematically, GVA is obtained by taking the sector's total output and deducting costs of the intermediate goods and services sourced from the third parties (e.g. ICT services, raw materials, electricity).  Employment captures the number of people who are directly employed in the pharmaceutical industry. 

In addition to the jobs and value created directly in the pharmaceutical companies themselves, the pharmaceutical industry also contributes to creating employment and income for subcontractors, such as transport, energy or services. These are known as indirect effects. Furthermore, additional jobs and added value are created that contribute to the country's GDP, when employees spend their wages, this is usually known as the induced effect.

To give a complete picture of the industry's total impact on the economy, it is essential to consider such indirect and induced effects. This project thus focused on estimating and analysing, direct, indirect and induced effects on employment and GDP.
